# Offensive Security Tools

This repository contains custom tools, scripts, and utilities I have built while learning penetration testing and offensive security.

The focus of these tools is on:

- **Automation** – simplifying repetitive recon and enumeration tasks  
- **Practical Usage** – utilities that support real-world pentesting workflows  
- **Clarity & Maintainability** – readable code and concise documentation  
- **Learning by Building** – implementing common attack concepts in Python, Bash, and PowerShell  

Examples of tools included (or planned):

- Recon and enumeration helpers  
- Nmap automation scripts  
- Directory and subdomain brute-forcers  
- Payload generators  
- Proof-of-concept exploit scripts  
- Windows/Linux privilege escalation helpers  

These tools represent my ongoing development as a penetration tester and offensive security engineer.
